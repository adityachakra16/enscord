<h1 style="text-align:center;">ENS Cord</h1>

A Discord bot that protects your ENS name from impersonators.

Today, anyone can change their Discord nickname to any ENS name and impersonate that person. This creates an **attack vector where a person can easily impersonate another reputable person and send messages on a Discord server** with malicious links and false announcements.

A corollary effect of preventing people from impersonating ENS names is that it makes ENS names a really good way for users to signal legitimacy.

## How it works

1. Add the ENS Cord discord bot to a discord server
2. Run the setup with the command - ` \setup`
3. Notify server members to verify ENS (can be done automatically with setup command)
4. Once verified, verified members get a 'Verified ENS' role.
5. As new members join, they are asked to verify their ENS (only if they have ENS setup as their display name).
6. Until verification is done, new members are given a role "Unverified ENS" which prevents them from posting messages on the server
